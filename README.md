This tool was created to control the Per Key RGB Keyboard of the Tuxedo Stellaris Slim 15 Gen 6.
I cannot guarantee that it works in the future or on any other device, but it works on my Laptop at the moment.
It uses the German Layout with also its special characters. It is possible to select one,
multiple or even all keys and then chose which colour they should be. On the righthand side,
the brightness of the keys can be changed with a slider. There exists a preset for all keys
to be in a layout with one colour corresponding to one finger in the touch typing system.
It is also possible to make the colours change in intervals, but therefore the program has to run
all the time in the background because it loops and if the program is closed, the loop will stop.
